    <h1>Game Development Reflection</h1>
        <p> Overall, our game was very successful. In its first stage of development during the feature lessons, the game had many issues and was loosely connected. Collaboration between teams grew after students turned to their classmates for help on specific features. Once we started working on Platformer 2 in different groups and had more focused roles, development of the game became very fast. More responsibility had to be taken for groups working with the Management Team, so one member was assigned to each group. I think that we handled our groups well, and managed the game's development as smoothly as possible.

    <h1>Event Reflection</h1>
        <p>Something in CSSE that impressed me was how well the teams were working together to display the project. Even though I wasn't there, I heard that there was a large game being played off the projector, which means that many people were attracted to our game. People seemed not only to really enjoy playing our game, but were also quite impressed. One parent came up to me and had a deep conversation with me about how the coding languages we used and what services like Github we used to create the game.

        Something from another class that impressed me was the web service from CSA. I think that it's cool how some teams put together resources for Nighthawks to use in case they need information or help. I also think that the style of the website was very well done, as I would've thought it was an official website created by the district. I also saw a cool project from a team in CSP that made a service similar to Quora, where asking a question would create a thread that other people could answer on. It was basic, but pretty cool.
