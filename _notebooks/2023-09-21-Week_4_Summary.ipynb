    "In this week, I was able to start on the JS Input calculator and Calculator. Edits on the JS Input calculator were slow, but I was able to make a lot of edits on the main Calculator. The first edit I made was adding the division operation, and then the square root operation with my Agile Methodology group. I tried doing a pi variable on my own, but was not able to figure it out. \n",

    "Other than the calculators, I put all my work in folders to better organize my repository, but they all disappeared from my schedule so I reverted this change. I think that this is because system was having trouble pulling my files, probably due them being in a folder. For example, it would be pulling from my /notebooks/filename, but then it was having trouble because I didn't tell it to pull from /notebook/weekfolder/filename. "
